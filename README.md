### Using SQL ORMS with Node.js

This project is a lightweight Node.js application that creates two database models and loads 
some data into them, configured in app.js. I made this project simply to experiment with the Sequelize ORM
and to prepare myself for an upcoming web project that will bring all these technologies together with 
Node, Express, Pug, and Sequelize.
